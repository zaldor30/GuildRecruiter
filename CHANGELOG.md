# Guild Recruiter
## 3.0.0 - War Within Release
I have done pretty much a full rewrite of Guild Recruiter.  I have added a lot of new features and fixed a lot of bugs.
Features:
- Reworked Settings and the GM/Personal invite system should be more clear.
- Black List will now immediately remove a player from the black list and there will not be a wait time.
- Added the ability to add zones to the zone list.  This will require a bit of searching on the internet to find the zone ID.
- Added Shift+Click to directly open scanner.
