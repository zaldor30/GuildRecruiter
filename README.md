Description
Guild Recruiter Features:

    Custom messages to send potential guild members.
    Custom filters for the /who search.
    A welcome message that appears when a guild member joins.
    Anti-spam, to prevent re-inviting a player within a certain number of days (controlled by the GM).
    Full sync system, to maintain invited player list, black list, and other data.
    Contains a list of zones (dungeons and raids) that will ignore players in those zones to now irritate them.

 
How to use:

    You can use /gr or /recruiter help (i.e. /gr help) to get a list of commands
    Settings will allow you to create messages to be sent to players.
    Settings will also all you to create custom filters.
        There are 2 default filters included with the addon to get you started.

 

This is a new addon and while I have been working hard to debug it, I am sure there will be issues.
