Guild Recruiter is a powerful tool for getting new guild members to join.

## Features

* Custom messages with ability to embed your guild link.
* Welcome message option for when players join the guild.
* Guild Master controlled antispam, keeps track of invites so you don't spam players.
* Full sync with other Guid Recruiter users.
* Antispam zones, if a player is in a current raid, dungeon, battleground etc, they will not get an invite.
* Much more!

## Documentation
* Use /gr or /recruiter to access the addon outside the minimap icon.
* /gr help or /recruiter help to see a list of options you can use.
* Make sure you go into the settings to add a message, custom filters etc.
* To move the screen, click the lock next to the X button.  When it is green,
    you can move the screen.  Click the lock again to lock it in place.

There is a filter by class and another by race that is included with the addon.

## Miscellaneous
This is a new addon and while I have been working hard to debug it, I am sure there will be issues.
