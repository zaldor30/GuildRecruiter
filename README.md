Guild Recruiter is now, the official replacement for FGI.  It is a guild recruitment addon that allows you to send messages to players that are not in a guild.  It also has a scanner that will scan the area around you for players that are not in a guild.  You can then invite them to your guild.

## Warning: Utilization of a guild recruitment addon can lead to a player being flagged for spamming.  Please use this addon responsibly.
<div align="center">This goes for any guild recruitment addon, not just Guild Recruiter.</div>

## Features

* Guild Master can force certain options to be use by other officers/recruiters.
* Sync your lists, messages, and settings with other guild recruiters.
* Custom messages with ability to embed your guild link.
* Guild greeting message when a player joins, that you invited.
* Whispered message to player when they join.
* Anti Spam Features:
    - Ignore players in zones that are PVP or current seasonal raid/dungeon.
    - Once invite is sent will not invite that player again for 7 to 180 days.
    - Able to add players to a black list, so they do not get future invites.
* Much more!

## Documentation
* Use /gr or /recruiter to access the addon outside the minimap icon.
* /gr help or /recruiter help to see a list of options you can use.
* Make sure you go into the settings to add a message, custom filters etc.

    you can move the screen.  Click the lock again to lock it in place.

There is a filter by class and another by race that is included with the addon.

## Miscellaneous
This is a new addon and while I have been working hard to debug it, I am sure there will be issues.
